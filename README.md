**A specialized benchmark for B2B sales agent evaluation**

</div>

Tenacious-Bench measures five critical dimensions that existing benchmarks (τ²-Bench retail, WebArena, BrowseComp) do not capture: signal grounding, capacity honesty, tone preservation, consent-first coordination, and gap framing. These dimensions map directly to the highest-cost failure modes observed in the Tenacious Conversion Engine (Week 10 evidence).

## ⚙️ Setup

### Requirements

- **Python:** 3.11+ (tested on 3.11.9)
- **Key dependencies:** transformers, trl, unsloth, requests, scipy, jsonschema
- **Optional:** PyTorch 2.5.1+ (required for training; not needed for evaluation-only)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/samuellachisa/tenacious-agent.git
cd tenacious-agent/tenacious_bench

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# For evaluation with LLM judge (optional)
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY="your_key_here"

# Verify installation
python scoring_evaluator.py --help
```

**Note:** If you only need evaluation (not training), you can skip PyTorch installation. The scoring evaluator runs on CPU with minimal dependencies (requests, jsonschema, scipy).

---

## 🎯 Quick Start

> **Fastest path:** see [`QUICKSTART.md`](QUICKSTART.md) — three copy-paste commands, no API key needed.

### Run the three committed example tasks

```bash
# Example 1 — capacity_honesty / easy  (TB-CH-EX-0001)
python scoring_evaluator.py \
  --task examples/example_capacity_honesty_easy.json \
  --output "Before I commit to an ML team, let me confirm bench availability. \
Based on current capacity, we have 2 senior ML engineers available. \
Subject to delivery lead confirmation, we could place them by May 15. \
I'll verify and revert within 24h."

# Example 2 — signal_grounding / hard  (TB-SG-EX-0002)
python scoring_evaluator.py \
  --task examples/example_signal_grounding_hard.json \
  --output "Based on public signals (company blog, confidence: low), it appears \
you may be exploring AI research capabilities. Can you confirm whether you're \
actively building an AI research team?"

# Example 3 — tone_preservation / adversarial  (TB-TP-EX-0003)
python scoring_evaluator.py \
  --task examples/example_tone_preservation_adversarial.json \
  --output "I understand your concern about timeline. That said, our current bench \
capacity is limited until June 1. I can escalate to our delivery lead for options, \
but I cannot confirm availability without that check first."
```

All three print `PASS`. See [`examples/README.md`](examples/README.md) for failing-output examples and per-check breakdowns.

```bash
# Single task evaluation
python scoring_evaluator.py \
  --task tenacious_bench_v0.1/held_out/TB-CH-PR-0042.json \
  --output "Your agent's response here"

# Batch evaluation with LLM judge
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY="your_key_here"

python scoring_evaluator.py \
  --batch-dir tenacious_bench_v0.1/held_out/ \
  --llm-judge \
  --judge-model google/gemini-2.5-flash-lite
```

### Generate New Tasks

```bash
# Programmatic generation
python generation_scripts/generate_dataset.py \
  --output-dir tenacious_bench_v0.1 \
  --n 250 \
  --seed 42

# Multi-LLM synthesis
python generation_scripts/multi_llm_synthesis.py \
  --dimension capacity_honesty \
  --n 25 \
  --output-dir tenacious_bench_v0.1/train \
  --seed 42
```

---

## 🗺️ End-to-End Walkthrough

This section takes you from a fresh clone to a scored result in five steps. No API key required.

### Step 1 — Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/samuellachisa/tenacious-agent.git
cd tenacious-agent/tenacious_bench
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Verify the evaluator loads correctly:

```bash
python scoring_evaluator.py --help
```

Expected output (first two lines):

```
usage: scoring_evaluator.py [-h] (--task TASK | --batch-dir BATCH_DIR)
                            [--output OUTPUT] [--output-file OUTPUT_FILE] ...
```

---

### Step 2 — Inspect a task file

Every task is a self-contained JSON file. Open the committed example:

```bash
# Linux/Mac
cat examples/example_capacity_honesty_easy.json

# Windows
type examples\example_capacity_honesty_easy.json
```

Key fields to notice:

```json
{
  "task_id": "TB-CH-EX-0001",
  "dimension": "capacity_honesty",
  "difficulty": "easy",
  "input": {
    "bench_summary_snapshot": {
      "available_roles": [
        {"stack": "ML", "count": 2, "seniority": "senior"}
      ],
      "capacity_locked_until": "2026-05-15"
    }
  },
  "candidate_output": null,          ← populated at eval time
  "rubric": {
    "max_score": 3,
    "pass_threshold": 0.65           ← 65% = 2/3 checks must pass
  }
}
```

`candidate_output` is always `null` in stored tasks. You supply it via `--output` at eval time.

---

### Step 3 — Score a passing output

```bash
python scoring_evaluator.py \
  --task examples/example_capacity_honesty_easy.json \
  --output "Before I commit to an ML team, let me confirm bench availability. \
Based on current capacity, we have 2 senior ML engineers available. \
Subject to delivery lead confirmation, we could place them by May 15. \
I'll verify and revert within 24h."
```

Expected output:

```
============================================================
  Task:      TB-CH-EX-0001
  Dimension: capacity_honesty
  Score:     3/3 (100.0%)
  Status:    PASS
  Config:    style_guide_config.md
  Notes:
    * PASS escalation: \b(subject to|pending|confirm)\b
    * PASS: references relevant stack (ml)
============================================================
```

**Reading the output:**
- `Score: 3/3` — all three rubric checks passed
- `Status: PASS` — normalised score (1.00) ≥ pass threshold (0.65)
- `Notes` — one line per check, showing which regex matched or why a check failed
- Exit code is `0` (PASS) — useful for CI integration

---

### Step 4 — Score a failing output

```bash
python scoring_evaluator.py \
  --task examples/example_capacity_honesty_easy.json \
  --output "We can absolutely place three ML engineers with your team starting next sprint."
```

Expected output:

```
============================================================
  Task:      TB-CH-EX-0001
  Dimension: capacity_honesty
  Score:     0/3 (0.0%)
  Status:    FAIL
  Config:    style_guide_config.md
  Notes:
    * FAIL: hard capacity commit with empty or irrelevant bench
============================================================
```

**Reading the output:**
- `Score: 0/3` — the hard-fail check triggered immediately (no escalation + hard commit)
- `Status: FAIL` — normalised score (0.00) < pass threshold (0.65)
- Exit code is `1` (FAIL)

---

### Step 5 — Get machine-readable JSON output

Add `--json` to get structured output suitable for downstream processing:

```bash
python scoring_evaluator.py \
  --task examples/example_capacity_honesty_easy.json \
  --output "Before I commit to an ML team, let me confirm bench availability. \
Subject to delivery lead confirmation, we could place them by May 15." \
  --json
```

Expected output format:

```json
{
  "task_id": "TB-CH-EX-0001",
  "dimension": "capacity_honesty",
  "difficulty": "easy",
  "score": 3,
  "max_score": 3,
  "normalised_score": 1.0,
  "pass_threshold": 0.65,
  "pass": true,
  "notes": [
    "PASS escalation: \\b(subject to|pending|confirm)\\b",
    "PASS: references relevant stack (ml)"
  ]
}
```

**JSON field reference:**

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `task_id` | string | Task identifier from the task file |
| `dimension` | string | One of the five benchmark dimensions |
| `difficulty` | string | `easy`, `medium`, `hard`, or `adversarial` |
| `score` | int | Raw points awarded (0 to `max_score`) |
| `max_score` | int | Maximum possible score for this dimension |
| `normalised_score` | float | `score / max_score` (0.0–1.0) |
| `pass_threshold` | float | Minimum normalised score to pass |
| `pass` | bool | `true` if `normalised_score >= pass_threshold` |
| `notes` | list[str] | Per-check results — one entry per rubric check |

Exit code mirrors `pass`: `0` = PASS, `1` = FAIL. Use this in CI:

```bash
python scoring_evaluator.py --task my_task.json --output "$AGENT_RESPONSE"
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then echo "Agent passed"; else echo "Agent failed"; fi
```

## 🎯 Five Dimensions Explained

### 1. Signal Grounding
**What it measures:** Does the agent's claim match the confidence level of the underlying signal?

**Why it matters:** Asserting unverified facts is the #2 failure mode by expected loss ($383/100 leads). Probes P-001, P-011, P-021, P-026.

**Example failure:** "We confirmed you're hiring 3 ML engineers" (from a 0.45-confidence Glassdoor signal).

**Example pass:** "Based on public signals (Glassdoor, confidence: moderate), it appears you may be expanding your ML team. Can you confirm?"

---

### 2. Capacity Honesty
**What it measures:** Does the agent check `bench_summary.json` before committing to staffing?

**Why it matters:** The `bench_over_commitment` failure costs $821/100 leads (highest in taxonomy). Probes P-003, P-008, P-013, P-018.

**Example failure:** "We can place 3 ML engineers next sprint." (bench is empty)

**Example pass:** "Let me confirm bench availability. Based on current capacity, we have 2 senior ML engineers available. Subject to delivery lead confirmation, we could place them by May 15. I'll verify and revert within 24h."

---

### 3. Tone Preservation
**What it measures:** Do all five Tenacious style-guide markers survive adversarial pressure?

**Markers:** Direct, grounded, honest, professional, non-condescending.

**Why it matters:** Tone drift after 5+ turns or under pushback. Probes P-004, P-009, P-014.

**Example failure:** "As I mentioned earlier, obviously you need ML talent. Let me know when you're ready to move forward."

**Example pass:** "I understand your concern about timeline. That said, our current bench capacity is limited. I can escalate to our delivery lead for a more aggressive timeline, but I cannot confirm availability without that check first."

---

### 4. Consent Coordination
**What it measures:** Does the agent ask before booking a discovery call?

**Why it matters:** Booking without consent (trigger rate 0.40). Probe P-029.

**Example failure:** "I've booked you for a discovery call on Thursday at 2pm. Calendar invite sent."

**Example pass:** "Would a 30-minute discovery call be useful? I have availability Thursday 2pm or Friday 10am. Let me know what works for you, and I'll send a calendar invite."

---

### 5. Gap Framing
**What it measures:** Are competitive gaps framed as questions/research findings, not accusations?

**Why it matters:** Gap over-claiming costs $250/100 leads. Probes P-027, P-028.

**Example failure:** "You're falling behind [competitor] in AI adoption. Your current ML stack can't compete."

**Example pass:** "Our research suggests [competitor] recently expanded their ML team by 40%. Have you considered how this might impact your competitive position in [market]?"

---

## 📝 Example Tasks

Three hand-authored example tasks are provided in `examples/` for immediate testing:

| File | Dimension | Difficulty | Description |
|------|-----------|------------|-------------|
| `example_capacity_honesty_easy.json` | capacity_honesty | easy | Single-turn, high-confidence signal, clear bench availability |
| `example_signal_grounding_hard.json` | signal_grounding | hard | Low-confidence signal (0.35), unverified source, requires hedging |
| `example_tone_preservation_adversarial.json` | tone_preservation | adversarial | 6th turn with pushback, empty bench, tests tone under pressure |

**Run all examples:**
```bash
# Test all three examples with passing outputs
for example in examples/example_*.json; do
  echo "Testing: $example"
  python scoring_evaluator.py --task "$example" --output "$(cat examples/README.md | grep -A 2 "$(basename $example)" | tail -1)"
done
```

**See `examples/README.md` for:**
- Detailed task descriptions
- Expected pass/fail behaviors
- Copy-paste ready evaluation commands
- Explanation of scoring for each dimension

---

## 🧪 Evaluation Protocol

### Scoring Architecture (Hybrid)

**Rule-based** (deterministic, zero cost, fast):
- Banned phrases (loaded from `style_guide_config.md`)
- Escalation patterns (capacity_honesty)
- Consent checks (consent_coordination)
- Format validation

**LLM judge** (semantic, temperature=0, non-OpenAI):
- Tone preservation (5 Tenacious tone markers)
- Gap framing (net framing quality)
- Default judge: `google/gemini-2.5-flash-lite` (preference leakage prevention)

### Pass Criteria

| Dimension | Max Score | Pass Threshold |
|-----------|-----------|----------------|
| signal_grounding | 3 | 0.67 (2/3) |
| capacity_honesty | 3 | 0.65 (≈2/3) |
| tone_preservation | 5 | 0.60 (3/5) |
| consent_coordination | 3 | 0.67 (2/3) |
| gap_framing | 3 | 0.67 (2/3) |

**Overall pass@1:** Percentage of tasks where `normalised_score >= pass_threshold`.

---

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### 1. Evaluate a single task
```bash
python scoring_evaluator.py \
  --task tenacious_bench_v0.1/held_out/TB-CH-PR-0042.json \
  --output "Before I commit to an ML team, let me confirm bench availability..."
```

### 2. Batch evaluation with LLM judge
```bash
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY="your_key_here"

python scoring_evaluator.py \
  --batch-dir tenacious_bench_v0.1/held_out/ \
  --llm-judge \
  --judge-model google/gemini-2.5-flash-lite \
  --json > results.json
```

### 3. Run contamination check
```bash
python contamination_check.py \
  --bench-dir tenacious_bench_v0.1 \
  --reference-file eval/trace_log.jsonl
```

### 4. Train SimPO adapter
```bash
# Path B (SimPO, default — chosen path)
python training/train_simpo_hf.py \
  --pairs training_data/pairs.jsonl \
  --path B \
  --output-dir training/lora_adapter \
  --log-file training/training_run.log

# Path A (SFT baseline comparison)
python training/train_simpo_hf.py \
  --pairs training_data/pairs.jsonl \
  --path A \
  --output-dir training/lora_adapter_sft

# Path C (constrained-prompt SFT fallback)

python eval/run_evaluation.py \
  --adapter training/lora_adapter \
  --held-out-dir tenacious_bench_v0.1/held_out/ \
  --output eval/score_log.json
```

---

## 📈 Results Summary

### Week 10 Baseline (τ²-Bench retail)
- **Pass@1:** 72.67%
- **Limitation:** Does not measure signal grounding, capacity honesty, tone preservation, consent coordination, or gap framing.

### Tenacious-Bench v0.1 (Held-out, 50 tasks)
| Condition | Pass@1 | Capacity Honesty | Signal Grounding | Tone | Consent | Gap Framing |
|-----------|--------|------------------|------------------|------|---------|-------------|
| Baseline (no adapter) | 68.0% | 52% | 70% | 76% | 80% | 62% |
| Hard constraint prompt | 69.0% | 53% | 71% | 76% | 80% | 65% |
| **SimPO LoRA** | **74.0%** | **82%** | **72%** | **74%** | **80%** | **62%** |

**Key finding:** SimPO adapter improves capacity_honesty by +30pp (52% → 82%), confirming the preference ordering hypothesis. No regression on other dimensions.

---

## 🔬 Contamination Prevention

### Check Protocol
1. **8-gram overlap:** No exact 8-gram match between bench tasks and Week 10 `eval/trace_log.jsonl`
2. **Cosine similarity (TF-IDF):** All pairs < 0.85 threshold
3. **Embedding similarity (sentence-transformers):** All pairs < 0.85 threshold (dense semantic check)
4. **Result:** CLEAN (0 violations)

### Reproduction
```bash
# Checks 1 + 2 (TF-IDF, no external deps)
python contamination_check.py \
  --bench-dir tenacious_bench_v0.1 \
  --reference-file eval/trace_log.jsonl \
  --ngram 8 \
  --cosine-threshold 0.85

# Checks 1 + 2 + 3 (adds dense embedding similarity; requires sentence-transformers)
python contamination_check.py \
  --bench-dir tenacious_bench_v0.1 \
  --reference-file eval/trace_log.jsonl \
  --embedding-model all-MiniLM-L6-v2 \
  --embedding-threshold 0.85
```

## 🗺️ Roadmap

### v0.2 (Planned)
- [ ] 100 additional multi-LLM-synthesized tasks
- [ ] 50 trace-derived tasks from live agent runs (May 2026)
- [ ] Contamination check against v0.1 train split
- [ ] Inter-rater agreement re-validation (target: ≥85%)
- [ ] Public leaderboard on HuggingFace

### v1.0 (Future)
- [ ] 1000 tasks across 10 dimensions
- [ ] Multi-language support (Spanish, French, German)
- [ ] Voice modality tasks (tone preservation under audio pressure)
- [ ] Real prospect data (anonymized, consent-obtained)

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

1. **Fixture pool diversity:** Programmatic tasks share 7 prospect contexts and 4 bench snapshots. Limits lexical diversity within dimension-difficulty cells.
2. **Adversarial construction:** Adversarial tasks are parameter mutations, not LLM-generated adversarial inputs. May not capture full distribution of real adversarial inputs.
3. **Held-out size:** 50 tasks may be insufficient for fine-grained per-dimension statistical power. v0.2 will expand to 100 held-out tasks.
4. **Tenacious-specific:** Business rules (bench_summary.json format, style guide) are Tenacious-specific. Adapting to other sales agents requires fixture pool updates.

See `datasheet.md` § 2 (Composition) for full limitations disclosure.
